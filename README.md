# 2D Word Generation Game
An engaging 2D tile based game with procedurally generated worlds, interactive minigames, and a dynamic player adventure system.

I created this project for my Data Structures & Algorithms course so it cannot be publicly shared. Please contact me directly if you'd like access to the code or a demo.

### Features
- Seed-based random world generation where rooms, hallways with turns and intersections, and encounters are randomely placed to scale on the world.
- A detailed UI with tiles representing floors, walls, rooms, hallways, coins, and other encounters.
- Interactive minigames with different objectives that provide players with coins and a goal to complete all minigames to beat the game.
- A robust player status system that keeps track of user health, coins, and position in coordinates on the world.
- Save and load functionallity for reliable game continuity, all game state features like health and position staying the same upon loading.
- Diverse input support, allowing users in the menu to start new games, load games, and quit games with keyboard inputs or mouse inputs.
- Determenistic and reproducable gameplay where each seed produces the exact same encounters, positions, and features.
